# signalbot
Signalbot is a Python script which can send Signal messages via Email and/or SMS (using www.clockworksms.com API). It's relying on signal-cli (https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli) to fetch the actual messages. Configuration is done in by renaming config_default.ini to config.ini and modifying it.
